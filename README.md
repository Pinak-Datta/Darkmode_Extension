# Darkmode_Extension
An Extension that switches between light and dark modes

The extension is named "DarkLit". The main purpose of it is to switch between dark and light themes.

In the manifest.json, you will find, the script that runs, is the popup.js. It contains all the functionality of the popup.

Styling and colours of the extension is done with the help of HTML and CSS.

The popup.js uses two components , appOn, and appOff, to handle the cases of The Dark Mode to be on or off.

It is still under the development phase. So some glitches might still persist. 
Any kind of contribution is heartily welcome. :)

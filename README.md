# DarkLit

- An extension that switches between light and dark modes. The main intention of `DarkLit` is to switch between dark and light themes. In the manifest.json, you will find an instance of an extension called popup.js, which contains all the functionality of the extension.

- The color schemes and styling of the extension are controlled by HTML and CSS.

- Two components: `appOn` and `appOff`, are used to handle cases when The Dark Mode is on or off in the popup.js.

- *Note: There may be some glitches while the project is under development. Your contributions would be greatly appreciated* :)
